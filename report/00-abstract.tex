    \large{\bf ABSTRACT}
\end{center}

The primary function of this section is to describe your work, what did you do and your key finding. For beginners, I recommend this five-part structure with fewer than 200-350 words but not more than a page.  Include only the most significant achievements of your study.  Using this template can help train your logic in arranging arguments. 

The first part is about speaking broadly about the importance of your area.  

The second part is for describing the problem.  

The third part describes what you did.

The fourth part describes your key result.  

The last part part the significance and key contribution.

\textbf{Around 6-10 sentences.  Around 200 - 350 words.  This is just guideline.  More important is to make sure you write just enough to convince the readers that your work is good.}
